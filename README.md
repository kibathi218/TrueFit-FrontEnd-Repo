#### An all encompassing fitness and diet tracker app. After creating an account, users are met with their own personilzed dashboard. Here they will have access to their Food Diary and Exercise Diary. In the Food Diary you can browse through the foods that we have in our database and also add your own foods. Then you can add the food to your diary which tracks your macronutrients for the day. Similarly to the Food Diary, in the Exercise Diary users are able to choose from a list of workouts or add their own.
